My solutions to [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/problems) problems in Haskell.

**Try yourself before looking at my solutions!**

Also, I do not claim that my solutions are the best.
Far from it in fact; Haskell is not yet my main language.
That said, they all give the correct answer, and they all give the answer in reasonable time.

Some have comments, some do not.
Some are fully working, some are WIP.
Some are pretty, others ugly.

If you have any questions, please contact me at jon@thesquareplanet.com.

If you have any suggestions for improvements (*not solutions to unsolved problems*),
feel free to open an issue or send a pull-request. Forks are also welcome!

Hopefully you might learn something. Or not.
